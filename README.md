## About
This is a Powershell script (WIP) I am developing to quickly read CPU, RAM, disk, GPU and other system information and output the 
information back to the user. It includes warnings based on certain conditions such as high CPU temperature and low disk space. 
I intend to add more functionality as I continue to work with the script.

## Features
- System Overview
Displays key system information including CPU, RAM, GPU, OS, and motherboard details.

- Storage Monitoring
Shows available and total disk space on the primary drive, with a warning for low disk space.

- CPU Temperature Check
Attempts to read CPU temperature via WMI and alerts if it exceeds safe thresholds. If CPU
temperature is unavailable, informs the user.

- Memory Details
Reports total installed memory, RAM speed, model, and manufacturer.

Future Plans (WIP)

- Add logging and export to file

- Expand to multiple drives

- Include network interface data
